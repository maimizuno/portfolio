                <span>Hello, </span>
                Thanks for visiting my portfolio website!
                <br>I am 
                <span>Mai Mizuno, </span>
                a Melbourne based 
                <span>web designer/developer </span>
                and a 
                <span>passionate IT student </span>
                    at Melbourne Polytechnic. 
            </h5>
            <!-- section2 -->
            <h5>
                I was 
                <span>born and raised in Japan </span>
                and my childhood was greatly influenced by my uncle who was a very skilful carpenter, this inspired 
                <span>my studies </span>
                in 
                <span>architecture </span>
                and 
                <span>industrial design </span>
                and leaded to opportunities 
                <span>working </span>
                as a 
                <span>commercial building designer,</span>
                where I was responsible for managing projects from concept to completion, specialising in interior design of restaurants, bars and hair-salons in Kyoto.

                <span>During my tenure </span>
                I was involved with a great variety of different clients from all corners of the world but 
                <span>faced </span>
                some 
                <span>difficulties communicating </span>
                (particularly English), as such I made the tough 
                <span>decision </span>
                to leave a great job in pursuit of improving my English skills and 
                <span>to study abroad </span>
                and live in an english speaking country, doing so would help immensely 
                <span>evolve my language </span>
                and overall life 
                <span>skills.</span>
            </h5>
            <h5>
                After 
                <span>arriving in Melbourne </span>
                in 2017, 
                <span>took </span>
                numerous 
                <span>courses </span>
                starting with general English subjects, then transitioned across to business, marketing and 
                <span>web design</span>
                , this provided great opportunities not only to study English, but also to develop a better understand of a different culture and other subjects I was 
                <span>interested in.</span>
            </h5>
            <!-- section4 -->
            <h5>
                During my journey I 
                <span>discovered </span>
                my 
                <span>true passion </span>
                and developed a great interest in the 
                <span>structural design </span>
                of information and communication through digital media. 
                Within this field I am strongly drawn towards 
                <span>coding </span>
                and 
                <span>programming </span>
                languages and 
                <span>the endless possibilities </span>
                enabling me to create almost anything, which I found just 
                <span>fascinating!</span>
            </h5>
            <!-- section5 -->
            <h5>
                As such, I decided to 
                <span>explore </span>
                and pursue the field of 
                <span>IT </span>
                and enrolled myself at Melbourne Polytechnic.  
                At the same time, I am 
                <span>looking for opportunities </span>
                to utilise my skills of designing and coding to 
                <span>build and develop websites </span>
                while continuing to study.
